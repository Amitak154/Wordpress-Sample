To get started, go to the “Actions” tab of your repository and click “Set up a workflow yourself.” This will open the workflow editor with a .yaml template that will be committed to the .github/workflows directory of your repository.
When saved, the workflow checks out your repo code and runs some echo commands. name helps follow the status and results later. run contains the shell commands you want to run in each step.


to Create a ssh key 
ssh-keygen

Configure server access and destination
For the rsync command to run successfully, GitHub needs access to SSH into your server. This can be accomplished by doing the following:

Generate a new SSH key (without a passphrase)
Add the public key to your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the production server
Add the private key as a secret with the name DEPLOY_KEY to the repository
